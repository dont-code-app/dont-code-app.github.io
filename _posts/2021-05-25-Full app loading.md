... is now delivered!

As a quick follow up to the last update, Previewer application now supports loading an application from scratch.
With the previously mentioned support from the Builder, one can just load, save or create a new application and see the result immediately.

In the [Builder Demo](https://dont-code.net/ide-ui/), you can load small applications already made: A Task Manager and a very simple Note Editor.
