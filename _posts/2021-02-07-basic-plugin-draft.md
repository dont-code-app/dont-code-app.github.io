We have now a working plugin showing entities
<!--more-->

Since its inception, the dont-code framework is progressing slowly but steadily.
As we want plugins to be tightly integrated into the framework itself, we have decided that all screens shown will be part of a plugin.

This is the purpose of the [Basic Plugin](https://github.com/dont-code/plugins/libs/basic), it manages the display of entities by listing them and editing them.
For now, it just shows table columns that dynamically adjust to the fields you declare in the editor 

Next steps, displaying a list of values, displaying edit form, running queries against the database...

By the way, the menu now supports moving, deleting and renaming entities.
