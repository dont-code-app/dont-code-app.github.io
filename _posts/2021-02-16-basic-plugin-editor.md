<!--more-->

Just a quick update to announce that the [Basic Plugin](https://github.com/dont-code/plugins/libs/basic)can now edit values of the entity 

The screenshots below show that for any created entities, you can list them (with dummy data), and as well edit them.

Thanks to all the work done previously, it's now quite fast to create these new features !
