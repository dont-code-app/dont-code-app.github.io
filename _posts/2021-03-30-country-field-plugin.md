How to manage countries with the no-code platform?
<!--more-->

We're happy to announce that a new plugin has been developed: The [Fields Plugin](https://github.com/dont-code/plugins/tree/master/libs/fields) provides a way to view / edit a Country.
It is now enabled by default in the Builder and the Previewer.

In the Builder, you can create a field of type Country:

Then, in the Previewer, you can select the country directly from the list:

and the values are displayed nicely with the flag in the list of elements:

You can see that with the power of the dont-code platform, a plugin developed once can be reused to any application.

By the way, the source code of [Fields Plugin in Github](https://github.com/dont-code/plugins/tree/master/libs/fields) is a great way to see how to develop a plugin for the dont-code no-code paltform.
