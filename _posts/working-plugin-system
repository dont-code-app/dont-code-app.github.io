A quick update as the plugin framework is now working
<!--more-->

We achieved quite a big step last week as the dont-code framework now supports loading plugins dynamically.
It supports two typea of plugins:

- The plugins can modify the behavior of the [Builder](https://github.com/dont-code/ide-ui). It can modify the model used by dont-code to describe an application, then the builder automatically adapts the questions to support it.
For example, the [test screen plugin]() adds the type field to the screen, and changes the screen proe
Perty dynamically when selected.
See the [before] and [after] comparison.

- As well plugins can enhance the [Previewer](https://github.com/dont-code/preview-ui) by registering to display any items in the model.
Dynamically the previewer will call the registered plugin and push any information to it.

Of course you can combine both in a single plugin, allowing you to add or modify any item in the editor and handle its display in the previewer !

To further enhance the plugin framework and make sure it is performant enough, even the core ui components of the previewer will be developed as plugins. You can find the basic ones in the following [repository]()

For example, 
- start the [Builder demo](https://dont-code.github.io/ide-ui/), then have it open the Previewer

- The previewer opens with default screen

- Then back to the editor, and change the application name
![Change app name](/assets/Builder%20change%20app%20name.png)
- See immediatly the builder just updated its title:

- Same if you add a new screen in the editor

- It creates a menu in the Previewer:
