A quick update as the plugin framework is now working
<!--more-->

We achieved quite a big step last week as the dont-code framework now supports loading plugins dynamically.
It supports two typea of plugins:

- The plugins can modify the behavior of the [Builder](https://github.com/dont-code/ide-ui). It can modify the model used by dont-code to describe an application. Then the builder will automatically adapt 

2. The [Previewer](https://github.com/dont-code/preview-ui) is where you see the result in realtime. It is connected to the Builder and reacts automatically to editions you make in the Builder
It is running in Angular + [Kor UI](https://github.com/eduferfer/kor)

For example, 
- start the [Builder demo](https://dont-code.github.io/ide-ui/), then have it open the Previewer
![by clicking here](/assets/Builder%20open%20Previewer.png)
- The previewer opens with default screen

- Then back to the editor, and change the application name
![Change app name](/assets/Builder%20change%20app%20name.png)
- See immediatly the builder just updated its title:

- Same if you add a new screen in the editor

- It creates a menu in the Previewer:
