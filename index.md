## What is it ?
- Users are guided by the framework to create their applications.

## How is it working ?
**It consists of an Application builder where you describe your application:**
![Builder](assets/IDE-Builder-Task-Manager-Simple.webm)

_You can try a [Demo version of the Builder here](https://dont-code.net/ide-ui)._

**And as well a [Previewer](https://dont-code.net/preview-ui) where you see the result in realtime**
![Previewer Edit](assets/Preview-Task-Manager-Simple.webm)

_You can try a [Demo version of the Previewer here](https://dont-code.net/preview-ui)._

## What is its status ?
