## Dont-code in a nutshell
The Dont-code platform is a suite of tools allowing any users to design their own applications with no IT knowledge.
As well, developers can provide plugins that extends the platform capabilities to suit any needs

- Users simply have to answer questions and fill placeholders to define their needs.
- The questions are dynamically generated from a model describing how an application should work.
- Plugins modify this model and enhance the questions to the users

## How is it working ?
**It consists of a [Builder](https://dont-code.net/ide-ui) where you describe your application, and as well a [Previewer](https://dont-code.net/preview-ui) where you see the result in realtime:**
