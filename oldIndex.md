## In a nutshell
**How to solve the dilemma of IT ?**: Users need an application developed for their own needs. Opensource solutions solve the technical challenges, but adapting them to user needs requires a lot of Enterprise IT expertise and time.

The Dont-code platform eases the relationship between these 3 actors:
- Opensource projects provide quality and highly generic solutions (say, an OAuth authentication framework).
- They are encapsulated into Dont-code plugins available in the Dont-code marketplace (OAuth Dont-code plugin).
- Enterprise IT configure this plugin for there specific identity provider, and push it to their Enterprise specific marketplace (Employees authentication plugin)
- Depending on their need, users design their custom applications with the plugins available in the Enterprise marketplace by telling the Dont-code Builder "I want employees to access the application".

## How is it working ?
[Try me !](https://dont-code.net/ide-ui){: .btn .btn--info}
- Users simply have to answer questions in the [Builder](https://dont-code.net/ide-ui) and fill placeholders to define their needs.
- The questions are dynamically generated from a model describing how an application should work.
- Plugins modify this model and enhance the questions to the users
- All changes done by the users are stored and shown in realtime in the [Previewer](https://dont-code.net/preview-ui)
